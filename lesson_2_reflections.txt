Git Course on Udacity Reflections for Lesson 2

Question 1:
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Answer:
When you initialize a repository, git will create a file ".git" that will start to track changes to your files
in the directory that you initialized Git in.  We need to do this so we can track changes, using the commit command.

Question 2:
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Answer:
The staging area is this middle ground between the working directory and the repository, a sort of limbo.  I believe
it is useful as a way to 1) make sure you are ready to commit the file or files to the repository as is, 2) double
check if the file or files you chose are the right ones you want to commit 3) group together files that go together
or are dependent on each other.
