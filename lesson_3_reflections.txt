Lesson 3 Reflections file

Question 1:
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Answer:
I would want a remote repository if I were to travel a lot, working in a group setting or just wanted to keep a back up of my data.
All of these options make keeping all you work local less than ideal.

Quesiton 2:
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Answer:
You might want to pull changes manually if you have been working in your repository on your local machine while your team members were working in the GitHub repository.  There may be merge conflicts or you may end up getting your work erased.

Question 3:
Describe the diggerences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Answer:
A branch is a seperate path from the file(s) you are working on.  A clone is when you copy a repository from a remote location to a local location or vice versa or even local to local (if you decided to move the contents on your computer). A fork is a type of clone, but only pertains to GitHub and allows you to clone another person's (or group's) repository into your own repository that you can then make edits and changes to.  Choosing to use a fork, branch or clone depends upon your situation. I would use a branch if I decided to work on a new feature for my program without messing with the actual program itself. I would use clone to copy my repository to/from GitHub from/to my computer.  As mentioned earlier, I would use fork to copy someone's repository on GitHub to my own personal repository so that I can work on the program(s) and/or file(s)
