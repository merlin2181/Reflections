Lesson 3 Reflections file

Question 1:
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Answer:
I would want a remote repository if I were to travel a lot, working in a group setting or just wanted to keep a back up of my data.
All of these options make keeping all you work local less than ideal.
